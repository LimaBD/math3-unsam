This file must be constantly updated to keep the script working.

To update this file follow the next steps:
1.	Visit Zillow and search in the map for properties.
2.	Open "Developer Tools" or press F12.
3.	Go to "Network" tab.
4.	Filter by "/GetSearchPageState.htm" and "Copy as cURL" the latest one.
4.1	if this requests has a 307 status code, click on url, solve Captcha and back to [1]
5.	Replace this text with the copied text and save.

This could be automated but I don't have time to do it right now.
